            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Right Reverend FATHER in GOD ANTHONY Lord Biſhop OF NORWICH, My Honoured DIOCESAN.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is too well known, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the purity of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and the Primitive <hi>Orders</hi> of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, eſtabliſhed in our Church; in all
<pb facs="tcp:40601:3"/>which Excellencies and Perfections no part of the Chriſtian World doth <hi>excel</hi> her, if any <hi>equal</hi> her; it hath been and ſtill is her portion, in Conformity to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> to his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and to the pureſt <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> to be aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and impugned, by the various oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of many <hi>Adverſaries.</hi> Beſides others, our <hi>Diſſenting Parties</hi> within this laſt year have been very active, both by other methods, and by <hi>Books</hi> of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds, expreſſing their objections againſt our <hi>publick Order</hi> and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
            <p>And one of them, for the juſtifying their <hi>ſeparation,</hi> hath adventured ſo far, as to charge the general uſe of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed <hi>Forms of Prayer</hi> to be <hi>ſinful:</hi> which if it were true, would indeed be an <hi>high accuſation</hi> againſt our publick worſhip, and therewith againſt all the famous <hi>Chriſtian Churches.</hi> He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends an Anſwer to all that I had ſaid, for the <hi>lawfulneſs and expediency</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40601:3"/>of fixed Liturgies: unto which I have here returned, as I hope, a ſufficient <hi>Reply.</hi> The manner of his writing, is in this reſpect, more commendable than of ſome others, in that he plainly <hi>ſtateth his Queſtion,</hi> and then produceth his <hi>Arguments,</hi> that the ſtrength of them may be fairly tried. But I could have wiſhed for his own ſake, that he had not oft intermixed his paſſionate and <hi>ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs aſperſions,</hi> upon our publick Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions and Miniſtry; and his talking at a high rate with <hi>confident words,</hi> upon very weak and ſlender appearances of Reaſon. For ſuch things are teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, either of the raſhneſs and <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the Writer, who brings theſe things as a ſupply, for want of what is <hi>rational</hi> and ſubſtantial; or elſe of the <hi>badneſs</hi> of the cauſe, which needs ſuch ſupports to maintain it.</p>
            <p>And though I thought this diſcourſe not at all like to prevail with <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding men;</hi> there were many
<pb facs="tcp:40601:4"/>things which enclined me to undertake an examination thereof. That Book is ſpread abroad, under the name of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of as <hi>great eſteem</hi> amongst our Diſſenters, as any other in theſe parts. There is a fair appearance of a regular way of <hi>reaſoning,</hi> though there wants ſtrength of Argument; and he more than once declares, that he thinks himſelf to have <hi>fully anſwered</hi> what I had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for <hi>Forms</hi> of Prayer; and therefore I was particularly concerned to ſhew his miſtake. And though the more <hi>cautious</hi> and wary men among our Diſſenters will not affirm the conſtant uſe of Forms to be <hi>ſinful,</hi> becauſe they think ſuch a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not defenſible; yet the Genius of that party is much ſet againſt them, and in their practice they reject them almoſt generally, with ſome eagerneſs: and therefore the determining this caſe, is of the greater concernment, with reſpect to our Non-Conformists in general.</p>
            <p>And I have had ſo much experience of
<pb facs="tcp:40601:4"/>the World, as to know, that the greater part of men are not ſo <hi>intelligent,</hi> and ſoberly conſiderative, as to ſearch into the ſtrength or weakneſs of Arguments, unleſs they be directed and aſſiſted: which defect when it meets with an unſteady temper, is the occaſion of much infelicity to Civil and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Society. And as I think it in any caſe, a piece of <hi>Chriſtian Charity,</hi> to guide men in their duty; ſo this is of greater moment, where the <hi>Peace</hi> of the Church is concerned, as well as the private <hi>duty</hi> of Chriſtians. But it was not the leaſt thing which prevailed with me to this undertaking, that the Book I anſwer, led me to the conſidering ſeveral <hi>miſtaken notions</hi> and aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and I hope to the clearing them, which having been preſumed to be truths, have miſguided many well-diſpoſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>Upon many accounts, this Diſcourſe addreſſeth it ſelf to your Lordſhip, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly entreating your acceptance thereof. It
<pb facs="tcp:40601:5"/>defends that common way of Chriſtian Worſhip, by <hi>publick Liturgies;</hi> which hath been the conſtant uſe of this eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Church, wherein your Lordſhip de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly enjoyeth an eminent place; and of the Reaſonableneſs and uſefulneſs of whoſe publick ſervice, your ſelf gave a ſeaſonable account. And probably the Book I anſwer, was alſo written within the limits of your Lordſhips Juriſdiction: and therefore I preſent this Diſcourſe to your view, craving your Approbation. And this I do with the greater confidence, becauſe of the <hi>truth</hi> of what I defend; the clearneſs and evidence whereof is ſuch, as will alſo, I hope, recommend it ſelf to any ſober and indifferent enquirer. I do confeſs I had this great advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Opponent, that I have <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt truth</hi> on my ſide, and this advantage I have made the beſt uſe of that I could. I am ſo apprehenſive of my own defects, that I cannot expect that this Treatiſe ſhould be in all things free from them. But I am
<pb facs="tcp:40601:5"/>ſenſible, that if I have trifled in the main ſubject, which is a matter of weight and ſeriouſneſs, I am ſo far from deſerving your Lordſhips favour herein, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably preſume on your pardon, for prefixing your name hereunto.</p>
            <p>But the chief reaſon of my preſenting this to your Lordſhip, is, that I might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a thankful acknowledgment of thoſe favourable reſpects I have received from you, and profeſs that real honour which my ſelf, with the reſt of your Clergy, have for you. And that God will preſerve and bleſs your Lordſhip, is the hearty deſire and Prayer of him, who according to his duty</p>

               <head>The <hi>Introduction,</hi> giving the Reader an account of the occaſion of this diſcourſe.</head>
               <p>HAving ſeveral years ſince publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my <hi>Libertas Eccleſiaſtica,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I endeavoured a Vindication of our Liturgy; there came lately to my hands a Diſcourſe, in which is a <hi>pretended anſwer</hi> to two Sections of my Book, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>lawfulneſs, expediency,</hi> and <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity</hi> of ſet <hi>forms of prayer.</hi> When I firſt looked into it, I thought it a ſtrange un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, to attempt to prove, that it is <hi>ſinful</hi> for Miniſters, who are able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40601:9"/>Prayers themſelves, to make uſe of any form of Prayer in their Miniſtration, which was compoſed by other men; and that any man might juſtly ſuſpect his own reaſoning, when it engaged him in ſuch an enterprize. But when I had read it, I found many things ſaid therein, which might poſſibly <hi>miſguide</hi> the weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary Reader, but nothing which was of any great weight. And indeed no falſe poſition is capable of being firmly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by ſolid Arguments, though to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcerning men, it may be rendred <hi>plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> by miſtaken fallacies.</p>
               <p>Yet becauſe I am very ſenſible, that the Aſſertion maintained by this Author, is both in it ſelf <hi>falſe</hi> and erroneous, and alſo tendeth to undermine the true <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Religion,</hi> and the Peace and Well-fare of the Church of God; I reſolved to examine all his <hi>Arguments,</hi> and to return a fair Anſwer to ſo much of his Book, as was needful for the <hi>diſcuſſing</hi> of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion propoſed, and for the <hi>defending</hi> my ſelf againſt his Oppoſitions. And this I thought my ſelf the more concerned to undertake, becauſe ſo far as this ſtrange aſſertion ſhould be received as true, it would make void the deſign of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Book, which was to manifeſt, that it was both <hi>lawful</hi> and a <hi>duty,</hi> for Miniſters
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40601:9"/>and People, to embrace, attend upon, and join in the <hi>publick ſervice,</hi> worſhip and Miniſtrations of the <hi>Church of England.</hi> And I knew not how far any appearances of reaſoning might be <hi>magnified,</hi> by ſuch perſons who are engaged againſt our <hi>Church,</hi> many of whom in a ſinking cauſe, (ſo far as concerneth the evidence of truth and reaſon) may be willing to catch hold on any twig.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Author</hi> of this Book hath not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed his own name therewith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall not be curious to enquire after it, but ſhall treat him as an <hi>unknown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> And I confeſs, I cannot eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that he under whoſe name it goes, ſhould be ſo defective both in <hi>learning</hi> and <hi>conſideration,</hi> as to be guilty of ſuch <hi>miſtakes</hi> and palpable over-ſights, as may be found in ſome places of this Book. For beſides many other unaccountable poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and <hi>miſunderſtandings,</hi> divers of which I ſhall mention in my following Diſcourſe; it is obſervable, that what he writes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>ancient practices</hi> of the Church, after the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> time; or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any thing written in thoſe days, is generally done ſo looſely, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with ſuch wonderful extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as may ſurprize an intelligent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with ſome kind of <hi>admiration:</hi> of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40601:10"/>which I ſhall give the Reader here one inſtance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When he ſpeaks of the <hi>original of Liturgies,</hi> he ſaith<note n="a" place="margin">Ch. 2. p. 68, 69.</note>, <hi>We do believe, that</hi> Gregory <hi>the Great, under the protection of</hi> Charles the Great, <hi>was the Father of all thoſe that dwell in theſe Tents, and this eight hundred or a thouſand years after Chriſt.</hi> But firſt to ſpeak of <hi>Gregory the Great,</hi> eight hundred or a thouſand years after Chriſt, is far enough from truth, when he died about the year 604. And ſecondly, that <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great ſhould be under the protection of <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> is impoſſible, when he was dead about two hundred years, before <hi>Charles</hi> the Great began his Reign. And thirdly, it is altogether as unaccountable, that the original of <hi>Liturgies</hi> was in the time ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Gerat, or <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, when they were in uſe many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before them both, as I ſhall ſhew<note n="b" place="margin">Ch. 3. Sect. 3.</note> in the following Treatiſe. This miſtake concerning theſe perſons, whoſe names were ſo famous in Hiſtory, that a man of ordinary reading could not be unacquainted with them, is as if any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould preſume to give an account of the <hi>Church of the Iſraelites,</hi> and ſhould aſſert, that the offering of <hi>Sacrifices</hi> under the Moſaical Law, had its beginning in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40601:10"/>the days of <hi>Eli</hi> the Prieſt, in the Reign of King <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> ſix hundred or eight hundred years after the Iſraelites came out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Surely it is a ſtrange confidence for any perſon to vent ſuch things, and to write poſitively what he no better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But whoever the <hi>Author</hi> of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is, I ſhall apply my ſelf to the <hi>clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> concerning the matter of it, which I ſhall do with as much ſuccinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as is expedient. And therefore though I ſhall not willingly <hi>omit</hi> any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, which he urgeth againſt the lawful uſe of conſtant publick <hi>Liturgies,</hi> or againſt what I have ſaid in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; yet where he mentions <hi>objections</hi> made by others, againſt the force of his Arguments, and gives his <hi>Anſwers</hi> to them, I ſhall paſs by ſuch things, where the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting upon them is not needful for the defence of our Church, or the deciſion of the Caſe propoſed. And in anſwering his Arguments, I ſhall wave the repetition of his <hi>long Syllogiſms,</hi> which is a tedious way of proceeding; and in rational Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of this nature, is acceptable to few others, than thoſe who may admire the art of making a <hi>Syllogiſm.</hi> But I ſhall give a faithful account of the ſubſtance of his <hi>Arguments,</hi> and leave it to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40601:11"/>Reader, to judge of the validity of my Anſwers. And that I may the more gratifie ſuch, who will compare his Diſcourſe and mine, I ſhall keep to his method which he hath uſed, except where he ſpeaks to the ſame thing in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent places, and in that Caſe I ſhall think it ſufficient to have ſpoken to it once for all. And I ſhall ſo order my Anſwer, that my <hi>firſt Chapter</hi> may anſwer his <hi>firſt,</hi> my ſecond his ſecond, and ſo onward to the end of his Book.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But touching my <hi>former Diſcourſe</hi> which this Writer <hi>oppoſeth,</hi> he ſeemeth not very well pleaſed, with my having choſen that ſubject<note n="c" place="margin">In his laſt leaf to the Reader.</note> to write on, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>defence of our Liturgy,</hi> nor with the <hi>time</hi> when my Book was written, which he ſaith was in that <hi>nick of time of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties moſt Gracious Indulgence,</hi> if it was poſſible to <hi>perſwade the Parliament,</hi> that there was <hi>no need of any indulgence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them.</hi> Now as to the ſubject <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of my <hi>Livertas Eccleſiaſtica,</hi> if he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like my having engaged therein, or my undertaking now to defend ſo much of two Sections thereof, as he hath oppoſed, I am content ſo far to bear his <hi>diſlike</hi> and cenſure; but I think my ſelf to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a ſufficient<note n="d" place="margin">Libert. Eccleſ. B. 1. Ch. 1.</note> account thereof. And if what he obſerves concerning the <hi>time</hi> was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40601:11"/>true, I think that was a fit time to <hi>defend</hi> and juſtify our Communion, when they who divide themſelves from us, made the greateſt oppoſition againſt it; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved themſelves in the heinous ſin of <hi>Schiſm.</hi> But the truth is, I was engaged in that work before that <hi>Declaration</hi> came abroad, but may Book was not <hi>publiſhed,</hi> till after his Majeſty had <hi>cancelled</hi> that Declaration: the Declaration which was made <hi>March</hi> 1671/2. was Cancelled about the end of 1672. and my Book came abroad in <hi>Octob.</hi> 1673.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But as to the <hi>perſwading our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> againſt any Indulgence or favour towards them, it is poſſible the poſitions of this Writer may do more to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, than I have done. I did indeed <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify</hi> the lawfulneſs of performing what is required of Miniſters, concerning the <hi>Liturgy;</hi> which was no more than to <hi>vindicate,</hi> what the practice and <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment</hi> of every conforming Miniſter had before owned. But I think it my duty, to leave the ordering of publick affairs to my <hi>ſuperiours,</hi> and did not by any expreſſion that I am aware of, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in their work.</p>

And we may ſee by<note n="e" place="margin">Ch. 10. p. 164.</note> the cloſe of his Book, that he accounteth it <hi>the only medium he can fancy, for a juſt comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> that there be no Forms of Prayer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, though they may be <hi>recommended by ſuperiours and left at liberty.</hi> And yet it ſeemeth probable from his<note n="f" place="margin">In the two laſt leaves.</note> 
                  <hi>Preface,</hi> that all this is not enough; for he there tells us of <hi>other ſix things</hi> he hath, <hi>to put in diſpute</hi> beſides this. I do not doubt but all thoſe ſix things, may be as eaſily <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered</hi> as produced: and the Reader may make a <hi>probable judgment</hi> of the ſtrength and force of thoſe other things, by this one which he hath <hi>ſingled out</hi> from the reſt, and therefore ſurely he thought it to be as conſiderable as any of the other.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And it might be expected, that he who is curiouſly ſevere, in judging of a <hi>fit time,</hi> for publiſhing other mens Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, ſhould have a ſufficient care of the <hi>ſeaſonableneſs</hi> of his own. And he who conſiders the buſineſs of our Enemies
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40601:12"/>abroad, and how they are <hi>encouraged</hi> by our diſcords at home, may well think, that they who have any true value for the <hi>Reformation,</hi> ſhould at this time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to promote a ſetled <hi>eſtabliſhment of the Church,</hi> which may tend to <hi>uphold</hi> and ſecure it. And ſince our <hi>diſſenters</hi> by ſufficient tryal, found in our late di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted times, that they could not <hi>erect,</hi> much leſs <hi>maintain</hi> any eſtabliſhment in their way, we may thence diſcern that no ſettlement can reaſonably be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but upon the foundations of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> which hath alſo the advantage of <hi>truth,</hi> and agreement with <hi>Primitive Chriſtianity.</hi> And therefore it was no <hi>fit time</hi> now to vent ſuch notions which <hi>widen</hi> our breaches, are inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with any publick <hi>eſtabliſhment</hi> of a Church, and which put <hi>advantages</hi> into the hands of other Enemies, and ſerve their purpoſes. And yet I confeſs this of the <hi>time,</hi> is the leaſt fault of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; but that which is the greater is, that the drift thereof tends to <hi>confuſion,</hi> and the things contained in it are <hi>unſound and untrue,</hi> which I ſhall now come to manifeſt.</p>

               <p>IN managing his oppoſition againſt the conſtant uſe of <hi>preſcribed Forms</hi> of Prayer,<note place="margin">The Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on propoſed, concerning the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of uſing Forms by Miniſters who have gifts.</note> the forementioned Writer doth in his firſt Chapter, give us the <hi>ſtate of the Queſtion,</hi> which he undertakes to diſpute, and therein he expreſſeth what he <hi>yieldeth,</hi> and granteth as lawful, and what he judgeth and eſteemeth to be <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> and undertaketh to prove it ſo: and herein he hath declared himſelf with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient <hi>clearneſs and plainneſs:</hi> What he contends for he thus expreſſeth,<note n="a" place="margin">Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, p. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>All that we affirm is this, That our Conſciences do from arguments, which to us at leaſt ſeem highly probable, judge, That it is unlawful for Miniſters, having the gift of prayer, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily to perform their miniſterial acts in ſolemn, ſtated, publick Prayer, by reading or reciting forms of Prayer compoſed by other men, confeſſedly, not divinely and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately inſpired, although our ſuperiours do requrie this of us.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. From theſe premiſes, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may yet have a little further inſight into the <hi>matter of this Queſtion:</hi> to which end he may conſider, Firſt, that our <hi>Prayer</hi> is directed to the moſt <hi>high God,</hi> and therefore it was called by the ancient Writers<note n="h" place="margin">Greg. Nyſ. de Orat.</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, an having to do with, and <hi>ſpeaking unto God.</hi> Secondly, that the <hi>ordinary wants</hi> of Chriſtians (except extraordinary
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40601:14"/>emergencies, which may be otherwiſe provided for) and conſequently the uſual <hi>matter of Prayer,</hi> for publick Aſſemblies eſpecially, is conſtantly the ſame. He who will deny this, muſt as well condemn the <hi>Directory,</hi> for<note n="k" place="margin">Direct. Of Aſſembling the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. Of publick Prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sermon <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> directing to the matter of publick Prayer, as the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> for expreſſing the words; nor can he have ſuch honourable thoughts as he ought to have, and as the Chriſtian Church always hath had, of the Contents of the <hi>Lords Prayer.</hi> Thirdly, that the granting it lawful, for a Miniſter to uſe a <hi>preſcribed Form</hi> of Prayer, of anothers compoſure, if he have not the gift of Prayer; is as much as to acknowledge, that ſuch a Prayer, piouſly performed, is a <hi>true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> of God, and may be acceptable to him; otherwiſe it would not be <hi>lawful.</hi> Fourthly, That the difference betwixt praying for the ſame things <hi>in a Form,</hi> and praying for them <hi>without a Form</hi> is this, that in the former way the ſame <hi>words and methods</hi> are conſtantly uſed, whereas in the latter the <hi>expreſſions</hi> are altered and <hi>changed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The reſult of this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther variety of expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence for the pleaſing God?</note> and oft-times the order and <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi> alſo, according as the perſon think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth fit, or as he is able to perform it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Wherefore fifthly, The main reſult of this <hi>Queſtion,</hi> at the laſt comes to this: Whether mens <hi>changing of expreſſions,</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40601:14"/>of phraſes, and <hi>altering</hi> their order and method in their Prayers to <hi>God,</hi> be things ſo valuable and conſiderable in his ſight, that his laws and will do require this, and that he hath ſuch an eye unto it, that the humble, devout, and <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſupplications,</hi> and addreſſes of pious perſons, are not <hi>acceptable</hi> to him, unleſs they be attended with ſuch <hi>variety of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,</hi> where the perſons have ſo much volubility of ſpeech? Now upon a ſhort view, it may appear, that the affirmative in this Queſtion, is very unlikely and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable upon ſeveral accounts.</p>

               <p>THE firſt Argument produced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the lawfulneſs of ordinarily uſing a <hi>ſet Form,</hi> by ſuch Miniſters who have a gift of Prayer, is becauſe (ſaith he) <hi>this gift is a mean given by God for the performance of this religious act of Prayer,</hi> and therefore<note n="a" place="margin">Reaſona.

                  <hi>may not be neglected or omitted.</hi> And he tells us by the <hi>gift of Prayer</hi> he means<note n="b" place="margin">p. 6.</note> a <hi>mans ability fitly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his mind to God in Prayer.</hi> And that ſuch a perſon, who is able fitly to expreſs his mind in his own words, ought to make uſe of them in publick Adminiſtrations, and may not lawfully <hi>pray by a Form;</hi> he endeavours to prove, by urging ſome Scriptures which require the uſe of ſome <hi>gifts,</hi> as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10, 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3, 6.</p>
               <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">What the gift of Prayer is?</note> Now that I may give the cleareſt ſatisfaction to the Reader in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, I ſhall not content my ſelf barely to anſwer this Argument, and to ſhew the weakneſs thereof; but I ſhall firſt give an account, What that is which is and may be called the <hi>Gift of Prayer?</hi> and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40601:22"/>how far this is afforded? and how far mens own abilities muſt be exerciſed?<note place="margin">Of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Prayer.</note> And for the better underſtanding of this, it muſt be obſerved, that a pious and <hi>devout Prayer,</hi> doth contain a great part of the lively exerciſe, and practice of Religion and Piety; eſpecially if we comprehend under the name of Prayer, both confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and thankſgiving. It includeth a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed owning the <hi>true God,</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> in him, and acknowledging him to be the <hi>Governour</hi> and diſpoſer of all things, and the <hi>Author</hi> of all good: and this is called by <hi>Philo</hi>

                  </gap>, a great Prayer. It taketh in alſo a profeſſed owning the <hi>Almighty power,</hi> infinite <hi>wiſdom, goodneſs, faithfulneſs</hi> and <hi>Omniſcience</hi> of God: and alſo the exerciſe of <hi>reverence,</hi> ſubmiſſion, humility, <hi>hope, affectionate deſire,</hi> heavenly mindedneſs, and repentance; together with a lively ſenſe and <hi>belief</hi> of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel grace and promiſes, and of the merits, Mediation and Interceſſion of our only <hi>Lord and Saviour;</hi> and a ſincere <hi>love</hi> to all men, and particularly to the <hi>Church,</hi> and our <hi>Governours,</hi> for whom we pray.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wherefore firſt, that is eminently and eſpecially to be eſteemed the <hi>gift of Prayer,</hi> which diſpoſeth and enableth to the performance of the duty of Prayer.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40601:23"/>And therefore ſince Prayer is not ſo much a verbal thing,<note place="margin">The gift of Prayer is a devout tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of mind</note> as a pious addreſs of the <hi>heart,</hi> ſoul and ſpirit unto God, Gods beſtowing the ſupplies and aſſiſtances of his <hi>grace,</hi> which kindle and excite <hi>pious diſpoſitions</hi> in ſeeking unto God, with earneſt and affectionate <hi>deſires,</hi> a lively <hi>faith,</hi> and the exerciſe of inward <hi>devotion;</hi> this is moſt properly his vouchſafing, and beſtowing the <hi>gift</hi> of Prayer: and our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and exerciſing them, is our having and uſing the <hi>gift</hi> of Prayer. For as the <hi>gift of Charity,</hi> doth not conſiſt in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the matters or rules of Charity, but in being inwardly diſpoſed to the lively practice of that divine grace, ſo is it alſo in Prayer. Now if any perſons ſhall here ſay (as ſome are uſed to ſpeak) that what I have expreſſed, is not the gift, but the <hi>grace of Prayer,</hi> he may conſider that by <hi>Grace,</hi> he can here underſtand nothing elſe but an excellent and <hi>gracious gift;</hi> and as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> declared<note n="d" place="margin">Aug.

                  <hi>Zec.</hi> 12.10. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. it is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably obſervable, that both theſe places
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40601:23"/>ſo far as they ſpeak of the <hi>ſpirit or gift of Prayer,</hi> have particular reſpect to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affection and <hi>devotion of the heart,</hi> and not, according to his notion, to the <hi>ability of expreſſion.</hi> The former place is Zec. 12.10. <hi>I will pour upon the inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>the ſpirit of grace and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; and they ſhall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn,</hi> &amp;c. Where the Hebrew word tranſlated <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications</hi> is by divers Interpreters, as the Chaldee Paraphraſt, the Septuagint, the Syriack and Arabick Verſions, and Pag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine, agreeably to the derivation of it, rendred <hi>Mercies</hi> or <hi>Compaſſions.</hi> And ſince the <hi>ſpirit of ſupplications,</hi> is the <hi>ſpirit of grace,</hi> it therefore is to be underſtood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common ſenſe of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, of <hi>piety</hi> of mind and affections, and an holy temper and diſpoſition of heart, to <hi>truſt in God</hi> and call upon him. And the following words, <hi>and they ſhall look upon me whom they have pierced, and ſhall mourn,</hi> &amp;c. will infer the ſame thing, if thoſe words be taken as expreſſions of true <hi>repentance,</hi> which is the ſenſe of many good Expoſitors; though ſome modern and<note n="f" place="margin">Euſ. Dem. Evang. l. 8. Teſt. 4.</note> ancient Writers, look upon them, as expreſſing the <hi>anguiſh</hi> of them who had deſpiſed and diſobeyed our Bleſſed Lord and Saviour.</p>

                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:40601:24"/>5. The other place is Rom. 8.26. <hi>The ſpirit helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what to pray for as we ought, but the ſpirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered.</hi> Now concerning the former part of theſe words, it cannot be conceived, that this great Apoſtle, and other Chriſtians at that time, ſhould be ignorant of the <hi>common matters</hi> of Chriſtian Prayer, who could not but be acquainted with<note n="g" place="margin">Aug. Ep. 121. ad Prob.</note> the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> but a conſiderable part of the ſenſe of this clauſe is, that whileſt under <hi>troubles</hi> and ſufferings, of which the Apoſtle was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing, even good men are apt to think their preſent redreſs and deliverance moſt deſirable, as this Apoſtle himſelf did the departing of that outward affliction which he calls<note n="h" place="margin">Aug. ib.

                  <hi>a thorn in the fleſh,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.7, 8, 10. the influence of Gods ſpirit di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects them to ſeek his Kingdom, and with hope, and patience, and ſubmiſſion, to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> themſelves unto the <hi>will of God,</hi> that that may be done on earth, and that his moſt wiſe Government ſhould order all their affairs in this life. And the guidance of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> by keeping pious men humble, preſerves them ordinarily from ſuch irregular inclinations and deſires, as appeared in the requeſt of the two Sons of <hi>Zebedee, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:40601:24"/>which they made to our Lord. And all this is performed by the influence of the grace of the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p n="6">6.

And the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of this gift being ſo great a part of Religion, and of ſingular uſe for obtaining various bleſſings from God, it ought by all men to be performed with the greateſt ſeriouſneſs. And as that <hi>abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of expreſſion,</hi> whereby a man largely profeſſeth the particular doctrines of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> in the ſeveral Articles of our Belief, is not properly the <hi>gift of Faith</hi> or of <hi>believing,</hi> ſo neither is the like abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of expreſſing the matter of our Prayer, to be accounted in any proper ſenſe the <hi>gift of Prayer,</hi> but rather of <hi>ſpeaking,</hi> utterance, or <hi>Elocution.</hi> But it is the inward gracious diſpoſitions, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our hearts and minds, which is the moſt powerful Oratory, to prevail with God. And this whether with or without a Form of words; yea whether joined with outward expreſſions, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſilence, is the <hi>effectual and fervent prayer of a righteous man,</hi> which <hi>availeth much.</hi> Hereby as <hi>Cl.

               <p n="9">9.<note place="margin">How far ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary gifts were to be uſed?</note> Now he who had this gift, ought to make uſe thereof in a due and regular manner, eſpecially ſo far as concerned the <hi>matter</hi> of this inſpiration and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.

But theſe eminent and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary motions being miraculous, were pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to that primitive time, for which they were calculated, when the Chriſtian Faith needed Confirmation, by the <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the ſpirit,</hi> both for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſtians, and the Converſion of others. But no man now can juſtly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſpeak or pray, by ſuch <hi>infallible inſpirations,</hi> nor ought he to be credited who ſhall ſo pretend. Yet they who then received theſe aſſiſtances, were not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged always to <hi>make uſe</hi> of them, meerly for the exerciſing of their gifts in the Chriſtian Aſſemblies; but they ought on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo far to uſe them, as was conſiſtent

               <p n="11">11.<note place="margin">Rules for the exerciſe of ſuch gifts laid down <hi>1 Cor. 14.</hi> conſidered.</note> My intention was to ſhew, that the uſe of <hi>particular gifts,</hi> is not of ſo great neceſſity in the Church, becauſe they are gifts, but that even ſome of the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary emanations of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> might be, and ought to be forborn to be exerciſed, where this forbearance tended to decent <hi>order,</hi> or <hi>edification.</hi> And if this be plainly proved from this Chapter, the general urging the neceſſity of the uſe of all <hi>gifts</hi> given of God, further than
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40601:27"/>that uſe is orderly and needful for edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, is an errour and miſtake.

Yea the uſe of the <hi>gift of tongues,</hi> though given by the ſpecial inſpiration of the Holy Spirit, was totally <hi>forbidden,</hi> where there was no <hi>interpreter, v.</hi> 23, 27, 28. and yet ſo far as concerns the nature of <hi>gifts,</hi> an ability to ſpeak with <hi>other tongues, by peculiar aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances</hi> of the Spirit, was as much, yea more a gift, than an ability of expreſſing our ſelves in our own tongue, without any ſuch extraordinary and peculiar aſſiſtance.

Now the reſult of what I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto diſcourſed is, that what our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor contends for, is neither the true and proper <hi>gift of Prayer,</hi> which is neceſſary to be exerciſed; nor yet any ſingular or <hi>peculiar gift</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit of God,</hi> as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial benefit of Chriſts Exaltation; but it is an <hi>ability</hi> of a more common and <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary nature.</hi> And that it is neither a duty, nor yet expedient, that ſuch abilities ſhould be uſed and <hi>conſtantly exerciſed,</hi> any further than is agreeable to the rules of <hi>edification and order.</hi> Thus much I thought fit to write for the Readers better ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, concerning the <hi>ſubject or matter</hi> of his firſt Argument; but I ſhall not need to do the like concerning the reſt: And now it will be no hard thing, to Anſwer the Argument it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="31">31. The ſubſtance of his Argument is,<note n="e" place="margin">Reaſ. Acc. p. 5, 6.</note> that a Miniſters own <hi>gift,</hi> of <hi>expreſſing his mind fitly to God in Prayer, is a mean given by God, for the performance of the Religious act of Prayer;</hi> and therefore <hi>may not be omitted,</hi> no not <hi>at the command of man.</hi> To which I Anſwer,</p>
               <p n="32">32. Firſt, That a <hi>mean given of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Means or abilities not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the performing duties, may be omitted.</note> if it be only capable of being uſed, and not a <hi>neceſſary mean</hi> to the performance of the duty, may lawfully be omitted. Eſpecially when there are <hi>ſeveral means,</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:40601:37"/>which may all of them ſingly be uſed, he who chuſeth one of them, and the <hi>most profitable,</hi> is not to be faulted, becauſe he doth not uſe the other which is <hi>leſs profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</hi> Thus in the publick Prayers of the Church; whereas a Miniſters <hi>preſent flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> of expreſſion, or his <hi>remembrance</hi> of what himſelf hath before conceived, with reſpect to that particular time; or his uſing a <hi>ſet Form,</hi> are different ways or means of performing this ſervice; he who chuſeth the laſt, which hath many <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages</hi> of the other two, is not to be blamed becauſe he doth not chuſe either of thoſe two. And by this it may appear, that this Writers own Argument, if it were of any ſtrength, might eaſily be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,</hi> and retorted againſt himſelf, if we put in the phraſe of a <hi>Form of Prayer,</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Miniſters own gift,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="33">33. Secondly, That <hi>ability of expreſſion</hi> was not peculiarly and particularly given by God to <hi>Miniſters,</hi> that they might thereby perform the publick <hi>Offices of Prayer.</hi> This is manifeſt, becauſe this is alſo given to them, whom God never calls to perform the <hi>publick Offices</hi> of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration. And alſo becauſe if our Lord had intended it, to be the duty of all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel, that they muſt uſe their own <hi>abilities of expreſſion</hi> in the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40601:37"/>Prayers of the Church, and might not make uſe of any Forms, he would not himſelf have given them an Example, of <hi>compoſing a Form of Prayer,</hi> and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this to be uſed by his <hi>own Apoſtles,</hi> and this too to be made uſe of, not as their <hi>private addreſſes,</hi> for themſelves alone; but with reſpect to the whole Chriſtian Society, and therefore beginning as was anciently obſerved<note n="f" place="margin">Cyp. de Orat.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40601:42"/>only in a perſons being able to <hi>expreſs</hi> his mind, whereas it is chiefly to be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the <hi>conceptions</hi> of his mind be ſober, and well ordered, comprehenſive, and every way ſutable to the nature of the duty. 2. In that he only mentions the expreſſing <hi>his mind;</hi> Whereas in publick Prayers, it is not a mans own private deſires or wants, ſo far as they are peculiar to himſelf, which he is to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> to God; but he is to expreſs what is fit, to repreſent the minds of the <hi>whole Aſſembly,</hi> and the common deſires and wants, and joint Devotions of all the Congregation.</p>

                  <p>HIS ſecond Argument againſt the lawfulneſs of the ordinary publick uſe of <hi>Forms,</hi> by him who hath abilities of expreſſing himſelf without them, is, that they <hi>hinder the attention, intention and fervency, both of Miniſter and people,</hi> and therefore<note n="a" place="margin">Reaſ.

                     <hi>may not be uſed.</hi> But this charge againſt well-ordered Forms, can never be made out: and his proofs will appear very weak and ſlender.</p>

Now I freely acknowledge and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert,<note place="margin">Pious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion greatly needful in Prayer.</note> that in our Prayer we ought to have a holy and <hi>Religious ſenſe of God,</hi> and of <hi>Jeſus</hi> our Mediator. We ought alſo to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40601:45"/>be ſerious in minding and attending to the duty in hand,<note place="margin">Ch.

And the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout we are, to the higher degree we are raiſed of this temper, and active diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of mind. This is indeed of great conſequence in our addreſſes to God, and as<note n="c" place="margin">Aug. de Temp.

If this be what he means by his attention and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; it will be readily granted, that that way or <hi>model of ſervice,</hi> which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders theſe duties, and is not conſiſtent with their exerciſe, is thereupon <hi>unlawfull</hi> And this ſeems to be his ſenſe, when he ſaith,<note n="d" place="margin">p. 33.</note> 
                     <hi>attention is for the ſoul,</hi> hoc agere, <hi>to do what it pretends to do:</hi> and by<note n="e" place="margin">p. 34.</note> 
                     <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> and fervour, he means, an <hi>holy zeal and heat</hi> — of the <hi>inward man,</hi> of <hi>ſorrow in confeſſion, deſires in petition, joy in thanksgiving.</hi> But there may be too great a ſtreſs laid upon <hi>zeal, earneſtneſs</hi> and fervency: ſince this is ſometimes found, even to ſome degree of <hi>ecſtaſie,</hi> in men of hot heads, ſtrong imaginations, and deluded minds, in whom it is far
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40601:45"/>from the temper of ſober devotion.<note place="margin">Sect.

Now I doubt not, but that a pious man may pray ſeriouſly, religiouſly and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, either in the uſe of a <hi>Form,</hi> or without one; but I think the former hath in many caſes the advantage, and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the publick ſervice of the Church, as may hereafter appear.</p>

                  <p n="11">11. Now here I grant,<note place="margin">A Religious man is more devout in a Form of Prayer by his frequent uſe of it.</note> that in ſuch a Form of Prayer, as the perſon hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before <hi>read or uſed,</hi> there can be no particular previous preparation of heart or affections, to join in the ſeveral Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof; and this in the <hi>firſt uſe</hi> of ſuch a Form, I admit and acknowledge to be a <hi>diſadvantage to devotion.</hi> But if thus much be true, it will manifeſt, that the <hi>people</hi> muſt be hindred in the fervency of their devotions, by joining in a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Prayer:</hi> becauſe being unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

                     <hi>their affections muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſpeakers words.</hi> And thus the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of what he aſſerts, doth wholly undermine and diſprove the latter, which was laid down without any proof at all: and this is the more conſiderable, becauſe the <hi>devotion of the people</hi> or the whole Congregation, rather than of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, is chiefly to be regarded in publick Prayer, and on their part lyeth this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. But in ſuch an <hi>ordinary Form,</hi> which he who miniſtreth is well <hi>acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with,</hi> there is no ſuch impediment to his devotion.

And that we may further ſee how much this Writer fights in the dark, and doth not weigh the force and tendency of what he urgeth; to prove Forms to be an obſtruction to fervency in Prayer, he tells us, they<note n="b" place="margin">p. 28, 29.</note> 
                     <hi>think it not poſſible, that the words of another ſhould ſo well fit our hearts, and be ſo expreſſive of raiſed affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as our own.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Some things urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt forms of Prayer, will equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude-againſt all publick worſhip.</note> Now theſe words are of no weight againſt Forms, ſince they may beſt expreſs what things we <hi>ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire:</hi> But I ſuppoſe he did not conſider, that what he thus ſpeaks, tends to declare, that the people cannot with <hi>fervent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> join with the Miniſter in any Prayer whatſoever, becauſe they are not their own words: and then all <hi>publick Prayer</hi> fitted to the people muſt be <hi>condemned;</hi> and ſo they muſt either take up with the <hi>Quakers ſilence,</hi> or the <hi>Romiſh ſervice,</hi> where the Aſſembly are not capable of underſtanding, and conſequently of join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Prieſts in their Service.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. But he hath another thing to urge, which particularly concerneth the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40601:50"/>reading</hi> of a Form: and that is, that then<note n="c" place="margin">p. 29.</note> the <hi>ſoul looks through the eye, and is diverted from its contemplation upon God.</hi> His ſenſe is, that the looking upon the words in the Book, muſt hinder his heart from being directed unto God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as he after ſaith,<note n="d" place="margin">
                        <hi>p. 31.</hi> and the ſame ſence <hi>p. 52.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>it is impoſſible, that any created being ſhould in the ſame action duly intend two objects.</hi> Now our Author is ſo unhappy in his Arguments, that they not only <hi>recoil</hi> with equal vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence upon himſelf, but what he urgeth, is againſt all <hi>vocal Prayer,</hi> whether of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters or others, in publick or in private; and alſo againſt others joining with them. For the <hi>conſidering of words, phraſes,</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and ſenſe, is a different thing in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Prayer, from the <hi>directing the heart</hi> and ſpirit unto God; and this muſt take up more of his mind and thoughts, than the looking upon a Book doth. And the <hi>peoples hearing</hi> and obſerving the words of Prayer ſpoken, is as different a thing from the motions of the mind toward God, as the <hi>ſeeing</hi> the ſame words is.<note place="margin">Reading or hearing words hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not the minding the ſence of them.</note> But in truth, ſince the main uſe of <hi>words</hi> is, that they are to expreſs <hi>things,</hi> the uſe of the <hi>ſame act</hi> about the word and the thing ſignified by it (as to underſtand each of them) or the uſe of ſuch <hi>different acts</hi> about the word and the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40601:51"/>by it, as to read or hear the one, and to underſtand or be affected with the other, are no impediments at all to the vigorous actings of our ſouls and minds. He muſt be no ordinary man, that is able to make out, that the ſeeing or hearing the words of any Propoſition or Diſcourſe, hindreth from clearly <hi>underſtanding the ſenſe</hi> thereof, when theſe words are wholly ſubſervient to the thing, to expreſs the ſenſe and meaning thereof. Nor can I be perſwaded, that I <hi>affect</hi> any thing of God or goodneſs the leſs, for hearing or read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch words, as repreſent and expreſs them, or direct and excite my affections towards them. And withal he who is well acquainted with a Form of Prayer, needeth no induſtrious exerciſe of his eye in the uſe thereof.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. But on the other hand,<note place="margin">Manifold advantages to piety from the uſe of Forms of Prayer.</note> ſince in ſuch <hi>conceived Prayers</hi> as our Author pleads for, the Miniſters mind muſt be imployed in <hi>conſidering</hi> and conceiving and digeſting his <hi>words,</hi> and his <hi>method,</hi> and <hi>ſenſe;</hi> and is apt to be ſometimes <hi>ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous,</hi> leſt he do amiſs in any of theſe, and may ſometimes have <hi>pleaſing reflexions</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own fluency; or the contrary; theſe things may more juſtly be eſteemed hindrances to his devotion. And beſides what I have aboveſaid concerning the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40601:51"/>devotions of the <hi>people,</hi> the uſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Prayers as the <hi>publick ſervice of the Church,</hi> may be an impediment thereof, upon theſe ſeveral accounts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are not certain, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that they can <hi>join</hi> in the matter of a new conceived Prayer, till they have well conſidered it, and therefore are the more apt to heſitate concerning it. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. In the time of Prayer they may be too apt to give their minds liberty of obſerving the <hi>expreſſions,</hi> and the manner of the <hi>compoſure</hi> of the Prayer, either to <hi>judge</hi> of it or <hi>imitate</hi> it, which tend to diſtract the mind, and divert it from the worſhip of God.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. And they further want this benefit which attendeth our publick Form, that the joining in that Prayer, which is with <hi>one accord</hi> put up to God, in the ſeveral Aſſemblies of our Church, may reaſonably be, and to many is, a quickning of their devotion, from the benefit of <hi>Chriſtian <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and the<note n="e" place="margin">Biſhop <hi>Sparrow</hi>'s Rationale of Com.

Concerning which Text S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> obſerved, that though ſome, not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole diſcourſe, made uſe of the laſt clauſe to encourage <hi>diviſion:</hi> yet it appears from the Connexion of that with the former Verſe; <hi>If two of you ſhall agree,</hi> &amp;c. that,<note n="f" place="margin">Cypr. de Unit.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40601:52"/>Dei Majeſtate, quod poſtulant; if they be gathered together with one accord, though they be but two or three, they may obtain what they ſeek for of the divine Majeſty.</hi> And therefore there may be a greater hope of obtaining thoſe very things, which we particularly know to be the joint deſire of ſo great a number of Chriſtians.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. Beſides this, there are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many perſons, who have not that <hi>quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of capacity,</hi> which is neceſſary for their hearts and affections to go along with <hi>new Prayers,</hi> who yet can piouſly and devoutly join in thoſe they have been well acquainted with.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. And withal, whenſoever there are (as is too frequent) any <hi>impertinencies,</hi> or unadviſed and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming expreſſions</hi> in conceived Prayer, or whatſoever is the reſult of <hi>paſſion, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence,</hi> negligence, weakneſs or bad principles and erroneous opinions, this muſt be expected to be a diſturbance and hindrance to the fervency and <hi>devotion</hi> of the Auditors.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. But becauſe I am apprehenſive,<note place="margin">Whether in the Apoſtles times all publick worſhip was performed by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary gifts.</note> that ſome may be apt to think, that much of what I have ſaid in the preferring the uſe of <hi>publick Forms</hi> to other conceived Prayers, may ſeem applicable at firſt view, to the <hi>Apoſtolical times</hi> alſo, as if the uſe of their <hi>miraculous gifts,</hi> when
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40601:52"/>they uſed no Forms, were to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued, I ſhall therefore deſire theſe things may be conſidered. Firſt, that as it is manifeſt, that under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they who had the gift of <hi>prophecy,</hi> were not at all times under the ſpecial impulſes of the divine ſpirit; ſo it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther certain nor probable, that in all the Primitive Churches, theſe <hi>extraordinary gifts</hi> were conſtantly afforded to all its Miniſters, for the performing all their Miniſtrations thereby. The Apoſtle's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to <hi>Timothy,</hi> to <hi>give attendance to reading,</hi> meditation, care and diligence, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13, 15, 16. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. do ſeem plainly to evince the contrary. And ſince the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> both at, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the coming of our Saviour, made conſtant uſe of <hi>Forms of prayer,</hi> as hath been obſerved by divers<note n="g" place="margin">Buxt. Syn. Jud. c. 5.</note> learned men, and the ſame hath been particularly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, both both from their <hi>Talmud,</hi> and <hi>Rituals,</hi> as well as from their other Rabbins by<note n="h" place="margin">Seld. in Eutychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</note> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Selden,</hi> as was obſerved by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                     <hi>Lightfoot;</hi> and conformably hereunto, the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> and our <hi>Saviour,</hi> taught their Diſciples <hi>Forms of Prayer:</hi> I ſee no reaſon at all to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the publick Prayers in thoſe early Primitive times, were never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40601:53"/>by the uſe of <hi>Forms.</hi> But of this the Reader may judge more when he hath read to the end of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Secondly, When they had theſe <hi>extraordinary aſſiſtances,</hi> it is but reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to think, that the Holy Spirit did not <hi>put</hi> them upon deſigned conſtant uſing <hi>variety of words,</hi> and new phraſes, in thoſe things which were their common and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual parts of worſhip. For ſince our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himſelf ſhewed his diſlike to the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or many and <hi>various words</hi> in Prayer, and gave an example for the due performance of it, in his <hi>comprehenſive Form;</hi> the Spirit of God in the Primitive Chriſtians, acting according to the will of God, would not guide them to what was contrary to our Saviours preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thirdly,<note place="margin">Great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Prayer by Apoſtolical and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary gifts, and other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Prayer.</note> Where there were ſuch extraordinary motions of the ſpirit, for the <hi>compoſing Prayers, Pſalms or Hymns,</hi> theſe were free from thoſe diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges I have above expreſſed, which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend conceived Prayers of other men. Under thoſe impulſes, the <hi>ſpeaker</hi> need not be ſolicitous in his thoughts, about words and compoſure. There could be no <hi>defects</hi> in the matter, or fulneſs of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, where theſe things were direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the guidance of the Spirit. And the plentiful effuſion of that Holy Spirit,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40601:53"/>tended rather more to promote <hi>inward fervency,</hi> and devotion of pious men, both ſpeaker and hearers, than to guide their expreſſions, ſince grace and holineſs were his chief gifts, and principal deſign. And the people could not make any <hi>doubts</hi> or demurs, about their ready conſent to every part of thoſe ſupplications, which were directed by extraordinary inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And the knowing that they were the ſpecial <hi>motions of the Holy Spirit,</hi> would both excite their attention, and raiſe the exerciſe of their faith and hope, in a firm confidence that thoſe <hi>interceſſions by the Holy Spirit,</hi> being certainly <hi>according to the will of God,</hi> were accepted of him.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Now though what I have ſaid may be ſufficient to anſwer his Argument, and to vindicate Forms of Prayer, from being any obſtructions to <hi>ſerious piety;</hi> yet with reſpect to this Argument, I ſhall deſire three things to be obſerved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. That <hi>Attention,</hi> and <hi>intention and fervency,</hi> as our Author expreſſeth them, is not the whole buſineſs, that is needful to be minded and taken care of in the <hi>publick ſervice of the Church,</hi> as he ſeems to intimate, both in the tendency of this Chapter, and particularly when he ſaith,<note n="k" place="margin">Reaſ. Acc. p. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>Attention of thoughts is not all our duty in Prayer, intention of ſpirit, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40601:54"/>fervency of affections is alſo a prime requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in Prayer, as intention and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency.</note> But men may be vigorous and earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the exerciſe of all this, while the <hi>matter of their Prayer</hi> may not be in all things ſutable to the will of God, and even when ſeveral things which ought to be part of our Religious Addreſſes, are <hi>omitted.</hi> Wherefore there muſt be a chief care that the <hi>matter</hi> of our Prayers be rightly ordered, and that our <hi>expreſſions</hi> and behaviour be ſuch, as manifeſt a <hi>due reverence</hi> to the Majeſty of God.

                     <hi>We will give our Reader a full account of what is ſaid by them;</hi> he hath not only been very defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in his account, but hath uttered divers manifeſt falſhoods.

                  <p n="18">18. To prove Forms of Prayer to be <hi>no diſadvantage to piety,</hi> I urged in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40601:64"/>my<note n="p" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ch. 4. p. 122, 123.</hi> Arguments to ſhew Forms of Prayer to be no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to piety. <hi>1.</hi> From God and our Saviour preſcribing them.</note> 
                     <hi>Libertas Eccleſiaſtica</hi> three Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. My firſt Argument was, <hi>That God himſelf preſcribed a conſtant Form of Prayer, for the Jewiſh offerings, and for the Prieſts bleſſing, and our Saviour directed the Lords Prayer as a Form: but the Holy God and our bleſſed Saviour, would not enjoin what is of its own nature an hindrance to godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, piety and Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. In anſwer to this Argument, our Author turns every way. He ſometimes <hi>miſrepreſents</hi> my ſenſe, as if I affirmed, that <hi>God and Chriſt had appointed the Forms of Prayer which are now ordinarily uſed, p.</hi> 56. or as if the ſcope of my Argument was to prove, that <hi>men</hi> may lawfully <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point</hi> what <hi>God</hi> may appoint, and ſaith the <hi>ſame Argument would prove a liberty for men to make new Scriptures, p.</hi> 56, 58. But the Queſtion under debate, was not at all concerning the <hi>authority</hi> of men, nor concerning the <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> of appointing Forms merely, but it was whether the uſe of them be an <hi>advantage</hi> or <hi>prejudice to Religion.</hi> Nor am I ſo void of all reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to God, as ever ſo much as to think, that any Creature hath an authority to do or command, whatſoever God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf can do or command. But the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what he further Anſwers, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to two heads.</p>

                     <hi>may legitimate ſome things by his Precept,</hi> which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would be unlawful: and then ſuch things being commanded, will be no <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to devotion,</hi> ſince <hi>God will ſecure his own inſtitutions.</hi> And here he tells us <hi>God might direct Images of Oxen and Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims to be in his Temple, and the people might worſhip before them; but</hi> Aaron <hi>might not make a golden Calf.</hi> And God might <hi>command</hi> Abraham <hi>to offer up</hi> Iſaac. And therefore this will <hi>only conclude, that Forms of Prayer are not in themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful as murther</hi> (though by his inſtance, they may be as unlawful as for a Father to kill his Son) <hi>or inceſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40601:71"/>Author ſpeak out the plain ſenſe of this ſuggeſtion? which is this, That himſelf and other <hi>diſſenters</hi> are men of far greater abilities than the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of our Saviour were, before his Reſurrection, though they were then called to be his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> were ſent forth to preach his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and were enabled to work <hi>miracles,</hi> and caſt out <hi>Devils:</hi> and conſequently that theſe men now, may reaſonably look upon ſuch directions and precepts to be of too <hi>low and inferiour</hi> a nature for them to obſerve, which yet were enjoined upon, and were fit for the ſtate of the Apoſtles before the Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. Thirdly his pretence of proof for this opinion is very ſhallow, which is<note n="z" place="margin">p. 58.</note> that Chriſt <hi>left out his own name</hi> in the Lords Prayer:<note place="margin">Of praying in the name of Chriſt.</note> but in that name his Diſciples were afterwards enjoined to ask: <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.13, 14. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.23. But to <hi>ask in his name,</hi> is to ask through his <hi>mediation,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the encouragement of his merits, and his being our <hi>interceſſor, and advocate at Gods right hand in our nature,</hi> which is a priviledge peculiar to the time ſince the aſcenſion of our Lord; and alſo to ask ſutably to the rules and doctrine of Chriſtianity. This is the ſenſe which is generally given, of this expreſſion, of asking <hi>in the name of Chriſt:</hi> and even
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40601:72"/>the Aſſemblies Annotations declare, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the name of Chriſt to be<note n="a" place="margin">Aſſembl. Annot. on Joh. 14.14. &amp; Ch. 16.24, 26.</note> 
                     <hi>through his mediation,</hi> and they alſo add from S. <hi>Gregory, ſi id quod non expedit petitur, non in nomine Jeſu petitur pater; if that be deſired which ſhould not be, God is not asked in the name of Jeſus.</hi> And this ſenſe of this phraſe, <hi>In his name,</hi> that it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies upon his account, and though him, is evident from <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.31. and many other places.

                  <p n="38">38. My ſecond Argument to prove <hi>Forms of Prayer to be no diſadvantage to devotion,</hi> was<note n="c" place="margin">Libert. Eccleſ. p. 122, 123.</note> becauſe <hi>it is generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that the ſinging Pſalms of Prayer and praiſe, may be advantageouſly performed in a ſet Form of words: and the Scriptures are not the leſs edifying becauſe they are contained in a ſet form of words.</hi> But concerning ſinging Pſalms this Writer ſaith,<note n="d" place="margin">p. 59.</note> this is <hi>a miſtake of the Queſtion;</hi> and<note n="e" place="margin">p. 60.</note> that theſe are <hi>ſuch Forms, as God hath Canonized.</hi> And he tells us he is <hi>againſt ſinging by any Forms</hi> not made of God, which he calls<note n="f" place="margin">p. 18, 19. &amp; p. 60.78.</note> 
                     <hi>Apocryphal Anthems,</hi> as much as he is againſt <hi>Liturgical Forms of Prayer.</hi> And yet he allows<note n="g" place="margin">p. 78. &amp; p. 60.</note> ſinging the Pſalms in <hi>Meter,</hi> though the words be not dictated of God,<note place="margin">My ſecond Argument was, that the Pſalms in a ſet Form of words are uſeful to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; and ſo are the Scriptures.</note> becauſe the ſenſe and matter in the Pſalms in Meter is ſo directed.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. But when he ſaith, this Argument <hi>miſtakes the Queſtion,</hi> the Reader will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſee it was proper enough, for the Queſtion or Caſe of which I was diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, which was in general, <hi>whether Forms
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40601:73"/>of Prayer are diſadvantageous to Piety.</hi> But our Author, that he might avoid the force of this and ſome other Arguments, hath put the Queſtion into another me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, but hath not done it ſolidly, nor hath he avoided the force of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereby. For firſt when he grants, concerning the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of Prayer and praiſe, that <hi>God hath Canonized</hi> thoſe <hi>Forms;</hi> he here aſſerteth, what in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the former Argument he would not own, <hi>viz.</hi> that God ever appointed or <hi>preſcribed any Forms of Prayer.</hi> And as the matter of many of the Pſalms is <hi>Prayer;</hi> So S. <hi>Hierome</hi> obſerves, there are<note n="h" place="margin">Hieron.

                     <hi>four Pſalms,</hi> which bear the <hi>title of Prayers,</hi> to wit as he counts them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Septuagint, Pſal.</hi> 16.85.89.101. but in our Engliſh Bibles, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.86.90.102. And from hence we may infer the <hi>uſefulneſs of Forms,</hi> for the promoting <hi>piety,</hi> according to the purport and deſign of my foregoing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
                  <p n="40">40.<note place="margin">Liturgies juſtified, by allowing Pſalms in Meter to be ſung.</note> Secondly, Whilſt he allows the uſing <hi>ſet Forms of Prayer, and praiſing God in meter,</hi> to be good and Religious, becauſe the <hi>matter</hi> is directed by God, though the expreſſions are not; he doth hereby, ſo far as concerns reaſon and Argument, yield that which will neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40601:73"/>infer the <hi>uſefulneſs of Liturgies,</hi> to be in like manner generally uſed. For the like allowance may certainly be made to the uſe of words <hi>in proſe,</hi> which may be made to them in meter; which is according to his ſenſe, that they may by all Chriſtians be profitably uſed, where the <hi>matter</hi> of them is none other, than what God himſelf hath directed us to pray for, and the words ſuch as are fit to expreſs that matter, which is according to his will. And there is greater ſecurity of the matter of a fixed well-conſidered <hi>Liturgy,</hi> being ſuch as God approves of, than there can be in the uſual variations of the <hi>conceived Prayers</hi> of ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of perſons.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. Thirdly, Whilſt our Author de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, he<note n="i" place="margin">

                     <hi>abhorreth any ſinging</hi> in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worſhip, or what is not compoſed by the Pen-men of holy Writ, even this alſo is very unreaſonable. The Scriptures indeed direct us both to <hi>pray,</hi> and to <hi>ſing praiſes</hi> to God: but it is the matter and pious performance of them, and not the different tone, or flexure of the voice, which God regardeth. And it is certainly as hard a task for him to prove, that we may <hi>ſing</hi> to God in no other <hi>Hymns,</hi> but what are expreſſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it would be for him to prove, that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40601:74"/>we may <hi>pray</hi> to God in no other <hi>Prayer,</hi> than what is contained in Scripture; which would be as much againſt other <hi>conceived Prayers,</hi> as againſt Forms. Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when in ſome <hi>ancient Churches,</hi> as well as modern, their practice was, what<note n="k" place="margin">Aug.

                  <p n="42">42. Fourthly, If it had been for our Authors purpoſe, he would have thought it a ſufficient proof from Scripture, for the <hi>compoſing new Hymns;</hi> that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſay,</hi> with reſpect to the Goſpel times, commands to <hi>ſing to the Lord a new ſong,</hi> Iſ. 42.10. And that the <hi>Angelical Hymn,</hi> Luk. 2. and thoſe of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> of <hi>Zechary,</hi> and of <hi>Simeon,</hi> were all of them newly compoſed for the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial occaſions; that the Apoſtle declared

And however this Writer cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth this, the general practice of the Chriſtian Church hath ever admitted and uſed ſome <hi>hymns compoſed by men,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a particular reſpect to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> as our Church ordereth the Son of S. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> Very many ſuch <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hymns</hi> are collected by<note n="l" place="margin">Caſſand.

                     <hi>Caſſander.</hi> And this practice was as early in the Church, as the end of the firſt Century, when <hi>Pliny</hi> upon Examination of the practice of the Chriſtians, in their Aſſemblies, found that they were wont upon a <hi>ſet day,</hi> to meet together before it was light,<note n="m" place="margin">Plin.

                     <hi>carménque Chriſto quaſi Deo dicere ſecum invicem,</hi> and to <hi>ſay an hymn to Chriſt as being God, one towards another.</hi> Now in that it was their uſual practice to ſay ſuch an Hymn, and that this was expreſſed by the generality of the Aſſembly, this ſpeaks it a Form which they uſed: and the phraſe of <hi>ſecum invicem</hi> is a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able intimation, that they expreſſed it by parts, or <hi>Reſponſals,</hi> one towards another.

But the true cauſe, why our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor doth not allow of any <hi>Hymns, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed</hi> ſince the Apoſtles time, is not from any Reaſon or Scripture, but becauſe this would not ſerve the intereſt of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and withal ſecure the practice of our Diſſenters.

                     <hi>there are Precepts for reading them, and alſo promiſes in the ſame caſe.</hi> But this doth the more ſtrengthen my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; becauſe ſuch Forms as are ſo far <hi>appointed</hi> and approved of God, can be no hindrances to Piety.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40601:79"/>of any part of the Chriſtian Church then oppoſing it, or declaring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.

                  <p n="11">11. Now in the ſenſe he taketh it, it doth go as far for the <hi>eſtabliſhing Forms of Liturgy,</hi> as agrees with the practice of our Church.

                     <hi>that the Prayers uſed by many perſons were daily amended, when they were declared to the more learned men;</hi> and that <hi>many things were found in them contrary to the Catholick Faith,</hi> — and that many perſons took up with <hi>Prayers compoſed not only by unskilful perſons, but alſo by Hereticks;</hi> I ſay when I conſider this, I encline to another ſenſe of this Council. And that is, that in the former part it makes conſtant proviſion, for the uſe of <hi>Forms ordered by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, in the publick ſervice</hi> of the Church; and in the latter part it takes care, that no private <hi>Books of devotion,</hi> which were compoſed by <hi>Hereticks,</hi> ſhould be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40601:81"/>by any <hi>Catholick Chriſtians;</hi> and the ſame thing was very probably taken care of in 3 <hi>Conc. Carth. c.</hi> 23. above mentioned.</p>

                     <hi>Milevis,</hi> that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and chief of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> were very ſevere againſt it, and yet they obliged themſelves to <hi>conſtant Forms.</hi> And when <hi>Coeleſtius</hi> an African Presbyter, had before this time earneſtly eſpouſed Pelagianiſm, there was<note n="d" place="margin">Oroſ. de Arbitr.

               <p>HIs third Argument is, that it is <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for Miniſters, having the gift of Prayer, to uſe preſcribed Forms, no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity compelling;</hi> becauſe God hath<note n="(a)" place="margin">Reaſ. Account, <hi>p.</hi> 71.</note> 
                  <hi>neither by the light of Nature directed them, nor in his Word preſcribed them.</hi> Now it is acknowledged, that all the <hi>parts of Divine Worſhip</hi> muſt be ſuch,<note place="margin">Of the parts of Divine Worſhip, and the manner of performing it.</note> as the light of <hi>Nature,</hi> or the <hi>revealed Will</hi> of God do direct. By the former, our dependance as Creatures, doth oblige us to acknowledg and honour God; and to call upon him, and <hi>pray</hi> unto him: And the holy Scriptures give us further Precepts, and encouragements in theſe Duties. And in the parts and duties of Divine Worſhip, the <hi>manner</hi> of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming them, and our outward expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions therein, muſt be ſuch as is ſutable to the Duty it ſelf; as ſwerveth from no <hi>Divine Precept,</hi> or Inſtitution; and is recommended either by the light of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40601:97"/>Nature or Scripture. But from what I have ſaid in the former Chapter, it may appear,<note place="margin">Forms of Prayer are agreeable to the light of Nature and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> that <hi>Forms of Prayer</hi> in the publick Worſhip of God, are recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> as it directeth us to chuſe the beſt, and moſt expedient and profitable way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming that Worſhip; and that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> alſo do encourage us in, and give their approbation of the uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But there is yet a further deſign in this Argument, which is, That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be <hi>uſed</hi> in God's Worſhip, which he hath not himſelf <hi>preſcribed.</hi> To this end, he ſaith, the ſenſe of the <hi>Second Commandment is this,</hi>
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">P. 73.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip in no other Way, by no other Means or Religious Rites, than what I have preſcribed:</hi> And again,<note n="(c)" place="margin">P. 75. &amp; the like P. 74.</note> 
                  <hi>We judg all Acts, Rites and Means of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip prohibited by God, which either in expreſs Terms, or by firſt conſequences from Scripture, are not preſcribed.</hi> Now if he will be conſiſtent with himſelf, and conclude any thing in the Caſe under debate from theſe things, which are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Poſitions,<note place="margin">And are not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den be the the Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and unproved Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than Arguments; his Inference muſt be, That no <hi>words and expreſſions</hi> (for of theſe we are now diſcourſing)
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40601:97"/>ought to be <hi>uſed</hi> in the Worſhip of God, which are not by him <hi>preſcribed.</hi> But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Argument, I ſhall obſerve three things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. That he here contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, what he declared in the ſtating his Queſtion, and hath oft repeated, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as he tells us,<note n="(d)" place="margin">P. 91.</note> 
                  <hi>Again and again, ſaid, That they do not think Forms of Prayer unlawful.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">This Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument Claſheth with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</note> But if they be not preſcribed, and all means not preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed be prohibited, they muſt be aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be <hi>unlawful.</hi> And being thus prohibited, no pretence of <hi>neceſſity</hi> on Mans part, can make them lawful. For according to that ancient rule, <hi>Nulla eſt neceſſitas delinquendi, quibus una eſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitas non delinquendi,</hi>
                  <note n="(e)" place="margin">Tertul.</note> 
                  <hi>It can be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver neceſſary for them to ſin, for whom it is only neceſſary that they do no ſin.</hi> And it is more neceſſary, to forbear any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>external expreſſion of Homage</hi> to God, than to make uſe of that which is unlawful and <hi>forbidden,</hi> as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the inſtance of <hi>Saul's ſacrificing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. By this way of arguing, the particular <hi>conceptions</hi> and expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of him who prayeth without a Form, are as much <hi>forbidden,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And will conclude Prayers without Forms to be fitful.</note> as the uſe of a <hi>Form</hi> is pretended to be; ſince God hath not <hi>preſcribed</hi> theſe Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

Nor is Religion, and the Worſhip of God placed in the bare reciting the words of a Form, but chiefly in the <hi>pious devotion</hi> of the Heart, of which theſe words are an expreſſion and guide.

We allow the <hi>Second Commandment,</hi> and the Rules of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture concerning God's Worſhip, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that no act of <hi>Divine Adoration</hi> be given to any thing elſe beſides God himſelf;<note place="margin">What God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, or command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Worſhip.</note> and that that <hi>Homage</hi> and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which is ſutable to his <hi>Nature,</hi> and according to his <hi>Will,</hi> be religiouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; and that no ſuch <hi>pretended Worſhip,</hi> which is unſutable to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or diſagreeing to his Will, ought

But becauſe, many private caſes, which may be of great concernment to particular <hi>perſons and Families,</hi> may be more properly taken into the ſubject of <hi>Family Devotions,</hi> than of publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies: it is expedient, and ordinarily neceſſary, that ſuch things alſo be upon emergent occaſions preſented to God, for obtaining his help and bleſſing, in as ſuitable words, as the perſon is able to expreſs, and without affecting <hi>variety of words.</hi> And in the <hi>Cloſet,</hi> many things concerning the perſons own particular caſe and wnats, which cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in a form, are needful matters of his private and <hi>retired Devotion:</hi> which may either be by <hi>vocal expreſſions,</hi> or only by the inward lively motions of a

But bleſſed be God our Governors are far enough from any ſuch thing, nor ought our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to propoſe it.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Wherefore the reſult of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is this, That the performing the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick offices</hi> of the Church by a ſet-form, is that which is really <hi>profitable</hi> to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity: and the appointing them to be ſo performed, ought not to be looked on, as meer act of <hi>Power and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> in our Superiors, which is deſigned no farther than to try the <hi>Subjects obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi> but in this caſe, it is a <hi>pious act</hi> of their <hi>Chriſtian care</hi> and prudence.

                  <note place="margin">Forms of Prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt expedient, do not prove it beſt to have conſtant Forms of Preaching.</note> which for many Ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Romiſh Corruptions over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread it, conſtantly uſed ſet <hi>Forms of Prayer,</hi> when their Sermons were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the <hi>Preachers</hi> themſelves, and the like uſage in our own Church, may incline modeſt men to think, that theſe Caſes are not alike.

                  <hi>Ancient Canons</hi> required their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent practice herein: And the uſe of ſuch <hi>Inſtructions</hi> or Exhortations, in the Chriſtian Aſſemblies, is of as early Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal as from the firſt Ages, as appears from the Teſtimonies of<note n="(c)" place="margin">Juſt.

               <p n="3">3. Firſt, Preaching is directed to <hi>Men,</hi> but publick Prayer to <hi>God</hi> in the

                  <hi>How many Diſcourſes of late years, have we had in Pulpits, pretending to prove, men have a natural power to things ſpiritually good; That we are not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by the imputed righteouſneſs of Chriſt, but by our own works? How many perfect Satyrs, Railleries, and evomitions of the luſts and choler in the Preachers hearts?</hi> Theſe are the kind words and <hi>meek expreſſions,</hi> of one who judgeth and cenſures the ſharpneſs of other men;
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:40601:116"/>and in almoſt every Chapter, he breaks out into the ſame temper and ſpirit of <hi>Reproaching.</hi> Now whoſoever they be,<note place="margin">Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor no fit perſon to complain of contumeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in Sermons.</note> who are over fierce and Satyrical in their words, I ſhall neither juſtifie nor excuſe them. But thus much I ſhall add, that within theſe Twenty years laſt paſt, I have heard very many Sermons, preached by Reverend and worthy perſons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> beſides what I have preached my ſelf; and in all theſe Diſcourſes, I do not remember, that I ever heard ſo many <hi>Contumelious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,</hi> towards our Diſſenters, as may be found againſt the Miniſtry of our Church, in this one little Book of our complaining Author.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And concerning Diſcourſes, to prove that men have a <hi>natural power to do things ſpiritually good,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of the power of men to do things ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually good.</note> it is eaſie to ſee through his miſtake. All the Miniſters of our Church, with thankfulneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and profeſs, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be the Saviour of the World; and that the <hi>new Covenant of grace</hi> is confirmed through him, and that we are now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this <hi>day of grace</hi> and Salvation; wherein God gives his aids and <hi>aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,</hi> beſides the inſtructions of his word, the mighty motives of his Goſpel, and the benefits of the <hi>Miniſtry of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:40601:117"/>and his holy Sacraments. And ſurely all this, is more than the power of Nature. Now to ſay, That men under <hi>theſe helps,</hi> if they be not wanting to themſelves, may work out their own Salvation, believe and ſubmit themſelves to the Doctrines of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and live Godly, Righteouſly and Soberly: this is not to exalt the <hi>power of Nature,</hi> as our Author miſtakes it, but it is to own the advantages of the <hi>Goſpel-Grace,</hi> and of the mediation and undertaking of our Saviour. But if under theſe <hi>gracious circumſtances,</hi> men are in no capacity of doing any <hi>ſpiritual good,</hi> or of being perſuaded to it; I cannot underſtand to what end <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> can tend, when it muſt be in vain to <hi>exhort</hi> them to their Duty, and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to <hi>reprove</hi> their neglect of it; Nor can they act without <hi>natural powers</hi> and faculties.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And concerning <hi>Juſtification</hi> there is as little reaſon for his complaint, as in the former head. We diſclaim every where <hi>merit</hi> in our own works and actions, and do here acknowledg, That our Saviour hath, as our mediator, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed by his Obedience, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Sacrifice, to expiate our Sins, give the ſanction to the new Covenant
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:40601:117"/>of Grace and Righteouſneſs and to aſſure the mercy of God, and pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs upon the terms thereof.<note place="margin">Of the terms arnd condition of our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, an its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Sacrifice of Chriſt.</note> But if we ſpeak of the <hi>Goſpel-condition of Juſtification,</hi> that muſt be performed by us our ſelves, and we do account, that as <hi>Repentance,</hi> which excludes forſaking evil and doing good, is a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the obtaining <hi>pardon of ſin</hi> (which I preſume no ſober Chriſtian will deny) ſo conſequently, it muſt be neceſſary to our being juſtified; unleſs we can be juſtified, and yet unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Or to ſpeak plainly, all ſin what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſtands forbidden by the <hi>Holy rules and precepts</hi> of the Goſpel, as much as by any other Diſpenſation: but the <hi>terms of the Goſpel-Covenant,</hi> are ſo gracious and extenſive, that they admit Repentance, tender pardon, and accept the ſincere obedience of the Chriſtian <hi>faith and life;</hi> yet all that is neceſſary, as the <hi>condition of the Goſpel,</hi> in order to our being <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted</hi> into Gods favour, is neceſſary to our <hi>juſtification.</hi> And that a renewed and <hi>Holy life</hi> is neceſſary hereto, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, from that wrath and <hi>threatning,</hi> denounced againſt workers of Iniquity, and from the impoſſibility for them to find favour, in the ſight of God, who
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:40601:118"/>do not <hi>do the Will of our Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. Yet the Goſpel-<hi>juſtification,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe terms of Grace in the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, is ſtill through the <hi>redemption of our Saviour,</hi> and faith in him: and from the benefit of his <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> we receive the pardon of our ſins, in the <hi>Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi> of the Goſpel eſpecially; in the adminiſtration of which Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is a principal part of the benefit of the <hi>Miniſtry of Reconciliation.</hi> But it cannot be, that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, ſhould be ſo imputed to us, that we ſhould be looked on, as having <hi>done</hi> or <hi>ſuffered,</hi> what he did or ſuffered: for then muſt every Chriſtian be reputed and looked on, as having performed the office of <hi>Mediator,</hi> and having paid to God the <hi>price of Redemption,</hi> for the ſins of the World, and as having made <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,</hi> and obtained thereby Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: and then beſides many other groſs abſurdities, they might be <hi>invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> on this account, for the diſpenſing the ſame. And they who are reputed to have performed compleat actual <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Obedience,</hi> need no ſuch Grace, whereby they muſt receive <hi>pardon</hi> and Remiſſion. But the Holy Jeſus by his Sacrifice, hath made a way of <hi>Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:40601:118"/>and, as our Mediator, hath by his Blood eſtabliſhed that new Covenant of Grace, whereby through his Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we may be juſtified, upon perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the <hi>Conditions of his Goſpel.</hi> And I ſee no other blame can be charged on this Doctrine, unleſs it be, that it is conſiſtent with it ſelf, and with what was delivered by the Apoſtles of our Lord.</p>

                  <hi>Miniſters who have the Gift of Prayer, to perform publick Vocal Prayer, by the preſcribed Forms of others, is to pretend to do an act of Worſhip, and at the ſame time not to do it,</hi> and is<note n="(b)" place="margin">P. 115</note> to <hi>mock God and deceive their own Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Now this is a very <hi>heavy Charge,</hi> if it be true, and can be proved; but if all this ſhall appear to be a falſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:40601:119"/>and to be untrue,<note place="margin">Ch.

And to make good his Charge, our Author muſt here <hi>recal</hi> and <hi>deny,</hi> what he hath ſo often grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the uſe of <hi>Forms of Prayer are in themſelves lawful,</hi> and that they may be lawfully uſed by Miniſters in ſome caſes. For if they be a <hi>mocking</hi> of God, and the duty of Prayer is not really performed, in the uſe of them, but is only pretended ſo to be, to the <hi>deceiving</hi> mens own Souls, then they are certainly <hi>unlawful.</hi>
               </p>

But in publick
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:40601:119"/>Prayer, Religious Devotion, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious diſpoſitions and deſires towards God, are the great things to be practiſed; and to that end, the uſe of a Form of words in publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, is well accommodated, as I have ſhewed, and therefore may be not only fitly, but profitably uſed.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

               <p>HIs ſeventh Argument is,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Reaſ. Acc. p. 120, 121.</note> That <hi>Miniſters performing their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial acts in Prayer, by preſcribed Forms, tends to level the ſacred Office of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, to the capacity of the meaneſt of the People:</hi> but ſaith he,<note n="(b)" place="margin">p. 121.</note> 
                  <hi>God would never have erected an Office, to do what the meaneſt perſon in the Church, hath a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ability to do.</hi> And he there adds, there is <hi>nothing plainer in the whole Book of God, than that God hath eſtabliſhed a peculiar order of perſons to be his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to declare his will unto his People, and on their behalf to intercede with God in Prayer.</hi> And he ſaith, if this<note n="(c)" place="margin">p. 122.</note> might be performed by Forms, there would be <hi>no great reaſon for any peculiar mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> for the Miniſtry, nor for <hi>Honour and Reverence</hi> to them. Now in anſwer to this, I ſhall obſerve four things:</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obſ. 1. That he gives a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective deſcription, of the work and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:40601:122"/>buſineſs of the Miniſtry; as if it only conſiſted in being Orators, and in the well uſing <hi>words</hi> and expreſſions.<note place="margin">Of the work and Office of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</note> And this is no more than a maſter of a Family may do, to inſtruct and pray for thoſe of his Family: but it muſt be the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of a ſpecial <hi>power of Office,</hi> which muſt be the chief Miniſterial performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of thoſe who are in the Sacred fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Miniſtry. Wherefore by <hi>ſpecial Authority</hi> and Commiſſion, to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> perſons into the Church, in the name of Chriſt; and to <hi>govern</hi> them in it, to exerciſe the power of the <hi>Keys,</hi> to conſecrate the holy <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and therein to exhibit in Chriſts name, the tender and ſeal of <hi>remiſſion</hi> of Sins, and by his Authority Miniſterially to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe <hi>Abſolution</hi> and <hi>Remiſſion,</hi> to them who are qualified to receive it, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the conditions of the Goſpel; theſe and other ſuch acts of <hi>Authority,</hi> are the great and chief parts of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial office, which he wholly omits. And even <hi>inſtructions</hi> and <hi>prayers,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by thoſe who are in this Sacred function, are of greater moment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their <hi>Office.</hi> But what God worketh by their Miniſtry, is eſpecially to be regarded; and if this was nothing, as<note n="(*)" place="margin">Chryſ. in 2 Tim. c. 1.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Obſ. 2. The uſe of Forms of Prayer is far from rendring <hi>learning,</hi> knowledg, and ſuch like abilities uſeleſs, or needleſs for the Miniſtry: nor can any man that knows the work and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Miniſter, judge ſo. Beſides his <hi>preaching,</hi> ſo as to approve himſelf a workman that need not be aſhamed; he is by his Office, to be a <hi>ſpiritual Guide</hi> to the conſciences of others,<note place="margin">Learning and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requiſite to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</note> when they apply themſelves to him for Counſel and Advice, not only for their comfort, but chiefly for their <hi>practice.</hi> He is to direct and <hi>oblige Offenders,</hi> who are under his care, to obſerve the due rules and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of <hi>Repentance;</hi> and this with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to conſcience, men ought to take more notice of, than moſt perſons do. And in a time, when the Church and Truth hath many enemies (and this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor might have been better employed, than to have appeared as one) the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Church are to be able to <hi>convince,</hi> or at leaſt to confound their Adverſaries, and <hi>detect</hi> their errors, and the danger of them.

The time when Liturgies were laid aſide in <hi>England,</hi> was that time when many of the meaneſt of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, both men of weak <hi>abilities,</hi> who yet could ſpeak confidently, and alſo men of bad and <hi>erroneous Principles,</hi> were thought fit to be taken into the Miniſtry, in the place of many ſound and able men, who were caſt out. And the performing <hi>Prayer,</hi> and popular <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> after that method our Author con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for, in expreſſion of their own, may be effected, to the ſatisfaction of great numbers of ordinary hearers (whatever may be pretended to the contrary) by a man who hath a <hi>forward tongue,</hi> and but indifferent parts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conſiderable learning or ſtudy, and without much knowledg of the <hi>Doctrines of Religion</hi> and Chriſtianity. There are ſo many evidences of this, among the ſeveral parties of our divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Separations, that the chief perſons
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:40601:123"/>among our <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> do very well know the Truth thereof.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. Our Author's aſſertion, That God would never <hi>erect an Office or Order of Perſons, to do what the meaneſt of the People, have a natural capacity to do, is alſo certainly falſe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Prieſts Office un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law.</note> For under the Law, the office of the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly appointed to miniſter before the Lord, by offering Incenſe and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, though <hi>Corah</hi> and his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and any other of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> had <hi>Natural Capacities</hi> of knowing how to order the <hi>Incenſe</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> as well as the Prieſts. And the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> was to offer the Sacrifices for Attonement, and to enter into the Holy of Holies, with the Blood thereof; and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other Rites of <hi>Expiation,</hi> to bleſs the People; and upon occaſion to ask coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and Thummim.</hi> The <hi>Levites</hi> alſo, were to wait on the ſervice of the Tabernacle. And theſe and ſuch like Rites, were accompanied with <hi>Prayers</hi> and Praiſes; but I have<note n="(d)" place="margin">Ch 3. Sect. 3.</note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſhewed, that preſcribed <hi>Forms</hi> were uſed in that Service. But none of theſe Perſons were by their relation to the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> or Temple, or by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Offices of Divine Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Scribes</hi> or <hi>Rabbins,</hi> or Doctors
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:40601:124"/>of the Law, and Sons of the Prophets, to <hi>teach</hi> the People in their Synagogues. Indeed after the time of <hi>David,</hi> when the Ark had reſt in the Tabernacle he pitched, many of the <hi>Levites</hi> were made <hi>Officers and Judges</hi> of the People, and were therefore to direct them in the Law of God, and the knowledg of his Will, and ſome of their <hi>Scribes</hi> might alſo be of this Tribe, as well as of any other. But this was not their <hi>Original Office,</hi> further than as good Men, and the ſpecial Servants of god to attend upon his Worſhip, they would by their <hi>Example,</hi> and no doubt by their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel alſo, <hi>excite</hi> others to perform care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the Service of God, and to keep his Law.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And with reſpect to what our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſpeaks,<note place="margin">God's Law made a large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the <hi>Levites</hi>
                  </note> concerning the <hi>Maintenance of the Miniſtry,</hi> it is worthy to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that God himſelf then thought fit, for the <hi>Honour</hi> of his Worſhip and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, to allot and appoint a <hi>greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,</hi> for the ſupport and plentiful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the <hi>Prieſts and Levites,</hi> than our <hi>Clergy</hi> now enjoy, and the Revenue of their <hi>Prieſts,</hi> was greater than that of our <hi>Biſhops.</hi> For the manifeſting of which, it may be conſidered, that after the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:40601:124"/>Tribes beſides the <hi>Levites,</hi> had males <hi>from twenty years old and upward, ſix hundred thouſand, three thouſand, five hundred and fifty,</hi> Numb. 1.45, 46, 47. But the <hi>Levites</hi> being numbred from a <hi>month old and upwards,</hi> were only <hi>twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and two thouſand,</hi> Numb. 3.39. And in reaſonable conjecture, thoſe of them who were under twenty years old, might be near as many, as thoſe who were above it. But if there were <hi>thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand</hi> Levites, who were twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years old and upwards, we will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon that Suppoſition as probable. Now God gave the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> all the <hi>Tenth,</hi> or Tith of the Land of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> Numb. 18.21, 24. and the other nine parts being reſerved to the other <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> theſe <hi>thirteen thouſand Levites,</hi> who were grown Men, had a larger proviſion, from theſe Tithes alone, than <hi>ſixty ſeven thouſand</hi> grown Men of the other <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had, though every one of theſe <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> was to have their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance</hi> of Freehold, and none was to be poor among them. So that every man of the <hi>Levites,</hi> had from this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue alone, a more ample Proviſion and Subſiſtance, than five Men of the other Tribes, who were heads of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, taking them one with another.
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40601:125"/>But then if to this be added, their own <hi>Flocks,</hi> and the Suburbs of their Cities, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35.2, 3. and their ſhare, in the <hi>extraordinary Tithe</hi> of the third Year, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.28, 29. and in ſome other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.12. <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.11.

                  <hi>If not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, yet experimented conſequence of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Forms, is a flood of Iniquity, for more than an hundred Years, cauſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> The Arguments for ſet Forms of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, are ſolid and ſubſtantial.</head>
               <p>IN his ninth Chapter, he mentioneth divers Arguments, produced for Forms of Prayer, to which he returns his anſwers. Now ſince I have above, not only anſwered his Arguments, but in ſeveral parts of my Diſcourſe, have proved the <hi>profitable uſe</hi> of Forms of Prayer, and have in my third<note n="(a)" place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>vindicated</hi> ſeveral Arguments, which I urged in my <hi>Libertas Eccleſiaſtica,</hi> it is not neceſſary for me to undertake the defence of others, which are inſiſted on by other men. But the five laſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments expreſſed in this Chapter, which were urged by my ſelf, I ſhall particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly conſider, reflecting alſo upon ſome other Arguments and expreſſions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And indeed my foregoing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:40601:130"/>hath given a <hi>ſufficient reply</hi> to many of his anſwers,<note place="margin">Ch. VIII.</note> to the Arguments he recites in this Chapter. For inſtance, To the firſt Argument for the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Miniſters uſing Forms,<note n="(b)" place="margin">
                     <hi>p. 134.</hi> Forms of Prayer are not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</note> that <hi>what God hath not forbidden is lawful,</hi> he anſwers, that Forms in the caſe by him ſtated, are <hi>forbidden by the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment;</hi> which I ſpake to, Chap. 4. that they are <hi>forbidden</hi> by the precepts <hi>to ſtir up gifts;</hi> which I conſidered, Chap. 2. and are <hi>forbidden</hi> by thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which require us to <hi>worſhip God with all our hearts, and with the greateſt attention and fervency;</hi> and of this I diſcourſed Chap. 3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the ſecond Argument, from the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> being a Form, and from the uſe of the <hi>Pſalms of</hi> David, and the <hi>Prieſtly bleſſing</hi> under the Law,<note n="(c)" place="margin">p. 135.136.</note> he only repeats what he had before ſpoken, and the miſtakes of which I have manifeſted, Chap. 3. Sect. 2.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The third Argument (which hath reſpect to 1 Cor. 14, 40.) is, that <hi>Forms of Prayer</hi>
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">
                     <hi>p. 136.</hi> Of matters of order, decency &amp; circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</note> are matters of <hi>meer decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, order and circumſtance,</hi> and therefore may be lawfully commanded and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed. Now though I account them to be more than ſo, and not to be only things of <hi>external order,</hi> but to be more
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:40601:130"/>
                  <hi>internally of profitable uſe,</hi> and conducive to the edification and good of the Church and its members; yet I ſhall obſerve what weak anſwers he gives to this Argument. As to <hi>order</hi> he ſaith<note n="(e)" place="margin">ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>order only reſpects</hi> prius <hi>and</hi> poſterius <hi>firſt and laſt.</hi> This was I conceive raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written; for ſurely he could not be ignorant, that the Apoſtles <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, had reſpect to order of <hi>regular conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and appointment, and not to order of number and mere <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> of one thing after another. Concerning <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,</hi> he ſaith<note n="(f)" place="margin">ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>nothing can be decent, but the contrary muſt be indecent.</hi> Now though a <hi>Form,</hi> and no <hi>Form,</hi> are not properly contrary, but rather contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; and though many <hi>indecencies</hi> have been committed, where Forms of Prayer have been rejected; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Forms is worſe than indecency, being an <hi>hurtful errour;</hi> yet his aſſertion is alſo falſe; a <hi>white Garment</hi> may be decent, and ſo may a <hi>black</hi> one, and yet white and black are contrary. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> he ſaith<note n="(g)" place="margin">p. 137.</note> 
                  <hi>Forms</hi> are no <hi>Circumſtances</hi> relating <hi>to the action as humane, becauſe it may be performed without them.</hi> By this reaſon <hi>ſtanding,</hi> or any other particular geſture in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is no circumſtance, which yet hath
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:40601:131"/>been uſually thought ſo:<note place="margin">Ch. IX.</note> and ſome <hi>geſture</hi> is at all times, and in all actions neceſſary. And as for the <hi>words of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayer,</hi> there can be no ſuch Prayer without <hi>any words,</hi> nor unleſs theſe words be <hi>fixed on,</hi> and determined by ſome perſon: but the <hi>ſenſe and matter,</hi> taken care of in Forms of Prayer, is of an higher nature than a Circumſtance. And he adds<note n="(h)" place="margin">ibid.</note> that <hi>he conceives</hi> no <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances</hi> appropriated to an action as <hi>Religious,</hi> are left to mens liberty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. According to which rule, it muſt be ſinful for a Father to <hi>command</hi> his Child, or for any man to determine himſelf, to <hi>kneel</hi> in Prayer, out of any <hi>reverence to God,</hi> becauſe, this is a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance to the action as <hi>Religious.</hi> If all this be not trifling, I know not what is.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fourth Argument is, that<note n="(i)" place="margin">ibid.</note> all the <hi>eſſentials to Prayer may be found</hi> (I would add, may in publick Prayer be beſt ſecured) <hi>in a preſcribed Form.</hi> This Prayer may be in the <hi>matter agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the will of God,</hi> it may be put up <hi>in the name of Chriſt,</hi> and it may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with exerciſe of <hi>Graces,</hi> and <hi>ſanctified Affections.</hi> But he here an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers<note n="(k)" place="margin">
                     <hi>p. 138.</hi> All things neceſſary and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to Prayer, may be in the uſe of a Form.</note> that the <hi>uſe of his own gifts</hi> is alſo neceſſary: but this pretence I have
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:40601:131"/>refuted, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. and I preſume, no pious man can eaſily think, that the will and pleaſure of God, ſhould require a mans own <hi>abilities</hi> to be exerciſed, merely to <hi>ſhew his parts,</hi> when the whole buſineſs of Religion, may be every way as well, or better performed without them; as may appear in every Miniſter under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to make new <hi>tranſlations of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> whenſoever he cites them, that his <hi>gift</hi> may be exerciſed. But he ſaith alſo, that<note n="(l)" place="margin">ibid.</note> he hath given his reaſons, why Praying by Forms cannot be with the ſame <hi>attention, and intention</hi> and ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: But theſe reaſons I have anſwered in my third Chapter, and have manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the contrary.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In his ſixth Argument, he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth 1 Tim. 2.1, 2. where the Apoſtle commands, that <hi>Prayers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>be made for all men,</hi> and here<note n="(m)" place="margin">p. 140.</note> he takes notice of what I ſaid, in my <hi>Libert as Eccleſiaſtica,</hi> p. 109. that <hi>many have thought the Apoſtle had a ſpecial eye to the compoſure of Forms of Prayer, agreeably to what the Baptiſt, and our Saviour preſcribed to their Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in this his command to</hi> Timothy, <hi>the Governour of the Church.</hi> And he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves that I added, <hi>though the phraſe</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>may either ſignifie, that Prayers be put up to God, or that they be
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:40601:132"/>compoſed, in this place it may well intend both.</hi> And I now add, That the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I have given of the uſe of <hi>Forms,</hi> in the earlieſt Ages of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and alſo in the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> makes it the more probable, that the Apoſtle might have ſome eye unto them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But he tells me, but upon what reaſon I know not,<note n="(n)" place="margin">P. 141.</note> that I am <hi>a little critical with the Verb</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſaith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a Poet comes from it; but he is but a miſerable Poet, who ſhould on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read or recite, Copies of Verſes compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by others.</hi> Now though I ſpeak of <hi>compoſing</hi> Prayers which might be reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or publickly uſed; yet to gratify our Author, I ſhall acquaint him, that though the Imperial Law of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> eſtabliſhed the uſe of Forms of Prayer, as I<note n="(o)" place="margin">Ch. 3. Sect. 3.</note> above ſhewed, yet the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by theſe Forms is<note n="(p)" place="margin">Juſtin. Novel. 137. <hi>c.</hi> 6.</note> there expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, he is but a <hi>little Critical,</hi> in imagining ſo unreaſonable a thing, as that the ſignification of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, muſt be every where accommodated to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a <hi>Poet.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors fancy about Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</note> And he is ſo unhappy in this his <hi>Fancy,</hi> as well as in his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that as weak as it is, it is not ſo much as fitted to ſerve his own <hi>Deſign.</hi> I am perſuaded that upon further
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:40601:132"/>thoughts, he will not open his mouth,<note place="margin">Ch. VIII.</note> for practiſing according to his own lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Criticiſm,</hi> or for <hi>making Prayers,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner that Poets make Verſes; who are for exerciſing their own <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> and gratifying the <hi>Humours</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, more than for keeping cloſe to <hi>truth,</hi> or minding what is <hi>ſerious.</hi> And I wiſh, that no ſuch miſcarriages may prevail with any, according to our Author's way and method, which he contends for. And with reſpect to the Speaker, if this Criticiſm was of any weight; as they are not the <hi>beſt Poets,</hi> who truſt themſelves to their preſent <hi>ſudden abilities</hi> of expreſſion; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they, who with great care, <hi>conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> both matter and words, and <hi>write</hi> them down, and have left their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings for <hi>laſting Monuments;</hi> thoſe alſo muſt be the beſt <hi>Prayers,</hi> which are compoſed in like manner. But for the <hi>People,</hi> they are utterly cut out, from having any part in <hi>making publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,</hi> or ſupplications to Almighty God, according to this conceit, though the Scriptures, and the Language of the Church, admit them to have a ſhare therein.</p>
               <p n="8">8. His ſeventh Argument, being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended as a general proof for the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:40601:133"/>
                  <hi>lawfulneſs of Forms</hi> enjoyned, is this,<note n="(q)" place="margin">Reaſ. Acc. p. 146.</note> that a man <hi>may lawfully determine himſelf</hi> to the uſe of Forms, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may be lawfully <hi>determined to them by his Superiours.</hi> Here he firſt tells us, this doth not reach <hi>his Queſtion,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Miniſters</hi> who have the gift of Prayer. But he ſaith further, A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hath a <hi>liberty to determine himſelf, where he may not lawfully be determined by his Superiour; as in caſe of Marriage to a particular Woman,</hi> in the <hi>choice of his Trade</hi> and courſe of Life, and a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter may determine himſelf, to <hi>write his Sermon</hi> conſtantly at length. Now theſe words, as many others in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, being written with reflection upon the <hi>authority of Superiours,</hi> I ſhall conſider the weight of them, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Caſe in hand.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Wherefore it may be obſerved, that there are <hi>two Caſes,</hi> concerning the <hi>matter</hi> of a Law, which may render it unlawful,<note place="margin">Of the lawfulneſs of being determined by our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, where we may deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our ſelves.</note> to be enacted by Superiours: The one when it takes away the juſt <hi>civil Rights,</hi> and freedoms of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and impoſeth unreaſonable <hi>needleſs burdens;</hi> the other when it is againſt the <hi>rules of Conſcience.</hi> In the former caſe it is true, that a man's own <hi>civil rights,</hi> are ſo far at his own diſpoſal,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:40601:133"/>and in his own power, that he may here <hi>determine himſelf,</hi> to what his Superiour may not <hi>determine</hi> him. Thus a free Subject of a conſiderable eſtate, may if he pleaſe ſettle his <hi>Eſtate</hi> upon another Perſon, or remove his <hi>Habitation</hi> into another Country, or reſolve upon a <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Life,</hi> or put himſelf into the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a <hi>Servant.</hi> Another Perſon of like competent Eſtate, may determine himſelf to a <hi>retired Life,</hi> a ſparing <hi>Diet,</hi> and a mean <hi>Garb;</hi> and if he be free from dependent Relations, may reſolve to give the ſurpluſage of his Eſtate to pious, publick, and <hi>charitable <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes.</hi> But it is not fit nor lawful for his <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,</hi> ſo to deprive him of his <hi>civil Rights,</hi> as to put upon him ſo much <hi>burden</hi> and <hi>trouble.</hi> But in things which are lawful or unlawful, according to the rules of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> where he may lawfully as to Conſcience <hi>determine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> to any thing, he may lawfully be determined by his <hi>Superiour;</hi> and if from the <hi>unlawfulneſs</hi> in Conſcience, he may not be determined, to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar thing by his Superiour, neither may he determine himſelf to it. And the reaſon of this is, becauſe if this thing be a <hi>Sin,</hi> a man may not lawfully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himſelf to it, but if it be <hi>no Sin,</hi>

For the proof whereof, I ſhall give ſome account, of the third Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. When the Apoſtle reflected upon
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:40601:147"/>the <hi>Strife,</hi> and <hi>diviſions</hi> of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> he thence pronounceth them to be carnal, and Babes in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1, 3, 4. or that they were of the <hi>loweſt ſort,</hi>

And whereas they were <hi>one of</hi> Paul, <hi>and another of</hi> Apollos, he ſhews them, that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollos,</hi> and all other Miniſters of Chriſt were <hi>labourers</hi> under God, and neither could, nor did, lay any other <hi>foundation than Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> v. 5.11. which is an Argument againſt <hi>dividing,</hi> Ch. 1.11, 12.</p>
               <p n="14">14.

And beſides the <hi>evidence</hi> that this Truth
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:40601:148"/>hath, from the ſcope, ſeries, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of this Apoſtolical Diſcourſe; it is manifeſt of it ſelf, that ſuch Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as theſe at <hi>Corinth</hi> were, which are ſo much decried and <hi>condemned,</hi> in the Doctrine of Chriſtianity, muſt be reckoned amongſt thoſe works, which ſhall <hi>not abide,</hi> but <hi>be burnt,</hi> to the <hi>loſs</hi> of them who are engaged in them.

               <p n="16">16. And this Apoſtle ſtill eying their Diviſions in the Church,<note place="margin">Dividing the Church, is a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>v. n. 11.</hi>

And to this purpoſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Diviſions,</hi> or <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi> are reckoned among thoſe <hi>fruits
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:40601:149"/>of the Fleſh,</hi> which exclude from the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> Gal. 5.20, 21. And yet further, with reſpect to the ſame thing, the Apoſtle, <hi>Ver.</hi> 18, 19, 20. ſhews, That what men may ſometimes account to be their <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> if it lead them amiſs (as particularly by bringing them into the paths of ſtrife and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi>) is no <hi>true wiſdom,</hi> but folly. And the ſame thing is aſſerted by St. <hi>James,</hi> Jam. 3.13, 14, 15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p n="17">17. And to make it manifeſt, that in this diſcourſe of the Apoſtle thus far, and alſo in his proceeding yet further, what he wrote was particularly directed to the caſe and miſcarriage of their <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions:</hi> From what he had hitherto ſaid,<note place="margin">The ſenſe above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> he deduceth this Inference, <hi>Ver.</hi> 21. <hi>Therefore let no man glory in Men,</hi> i.e. to make <hi>Factions</hi> and Diviſions, out of pretence of the <hi>eſteem</hi> they have, even of <hi>Paul, Apollos, Cephas,</hi> or any other. And he directs, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Let a man ſo account of us, as of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and Stewards of the Myſteries of God.</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 6. he tells them, <hi>Theſe things I have in a Figure, transferred to my Self and to</hi> Apollos, <hi>for your ſakes, that you might learn in us, not to think of men, above that which is written, that
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:40601:149"/>no one of your be puffed up for one againſt another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. And that no man may ſlight and <hi>deſpiſe</hi> this conſideration, and ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that as he can <hi>pleaſe</hi> himſelf in ſuch undertakings, ſo God ſurely can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo diſpleaſed, with theſe Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, I ſhall take a little notice of the evil <hi>temper,</hi> that generally attends them. Beſides,<note place="margin">The evil attendants of Schiſm.</note> the hurt that is done to the <hi>Church of God,</hi> to Religion, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men; the engaging in Separation, is alſo uſually accompanied with <hi>many diſorders</hi> of Mind and Practice. Here are <hi>Prejudices</hi> towards them, from whom they divide, with diſordered <hi>heats and cenſoriouſneſs;</hi> a neglect of due <hi>reverence</hi> to Superiours; and a proneneſs to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace ſome <hi>particular Opinions,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome things in Religion, whereby they may diſtinguiſh their Party, and by oppoſing others herein, keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at a greater <hi>diſtance</hi> from them. And withal, the offending Perſons are here ordinarily ſo far pleaſed with, and ready to juſtifie, and <hi>approve</hi> their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, that they are not willing to <hi>examine</hi> their own Errors and Miſtakes; are far from being pleaſed with him, who ſhall <hi>reprove</hi> their faults, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:40601:150"/>with him alſo, who ſhall in the mildeſt and kindeſt manner <hi>perſuade</hi> them, to conſider of their Duty, and return unto it. And this temper of mind, beſides the various woful <hi>fruits,</hi> and manifeſt conſequents of Diviſions themſelves, may well provoke the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Wherefore as every Perſon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lueth and eſteemeth the <hi>pleaſing God,</hi> and minding the <hi>duties</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> which are things of mighty concernment and abſolute neceſſity; they muſt not think,<note place="margin">Care of Unity is greatly neceſſary.</note> they may ſafely omit the <hi>duty of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> or any other great command of the Goſpel, and practiſe only ſuch Rules and Precepts, as themſelves pleaſe. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> did beſeech his Epheſians, Eph. 4.1. <hi>to walk worthy of the Vocation wherewith they were called;</hi> he to this end, among other duties, inſiſts moſt particularly, and moſt largely, upon <hi>keeping the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace;</hi> and inforceth this by very many Arguments, and Obligations to <hi>Chriſtian <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> v. 3.4, 5, 6. And I hope I need add no more, but the Apoſtles concluſive words, in his latter Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gives his <hi>Apoſtolical Bleſſing,</hi> to
